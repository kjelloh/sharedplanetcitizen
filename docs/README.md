# Shared Planet Citizen

This project is for anyone — in any walk of life — who wants to live with eyes open in the face of our shared human mess. But also accept our shortcomings in our ability to do so.

A call to step into your role — not as a perfect person, but as a fallible, feeling, thinking participant in shaping the world we share.

You are not outside the system. You are already in it.  
You are not alone. You are already part of the pattern.

- Let’s mean business — as citizens of a shared planet, not spectators or cynics.
- Let’s cultivate a grounded love for life — one that works through contradiction, not around it.
- Let’s stay curious about ourselves — our impact, our blind spots, our potential.

**Shared Planet Citizen** is an open invitation to grow your part in the larger human experiment — not by having all the answers, but by learning to navigate better.

It’s about showing up with awareness. Owning your influence. Asking better questions. Taking action that aligns with what matters — while knowing you won’t always get it right. Knowing that the future is a betting game. Knowing there is only so much you can do. But whatever you do or not do matters.

## A Declaration of Dependence

We grew up on stories of independence.  
Of standing alone. Of forging our own way. Of cutting ties.

But this is a declaration of something deeper:  
**We depend on one another.**

On food we didn’t grow. Roads we didn’t pave.  
Ideas we didn’t invent. Kindness we didn’t earn.

To be a citizen of this planet is to recognize:  
You didn’t make this world alone.  
And you won’t fix it alone.

Our task is not to transcend this fact — but to own it.  
To shoulder responsibility for the ways we affect one another.  
To do so with honesty about our limits, and humility about our power.

Dependence is not weakness — it’s reality.  
The question is whether we meet it with denial, or with care.

## We use “citizen” in the broadest sense: a participant in the shared.

Not just a legal status, but a stance — someone who accepts that they are *in* the world and *of* it.  
Someone who shows up. Pays attention. Takes part. Shapes the shapeable.

This is for anyone who wants to take the project of being human seriously — with humility, humor, and a hunger to grow.

## No moral high ground. No perfect path.

Just the ongoing, fallible, and honest effort to act in alignment with your values — and let your values evolve as you go.

## What does this look like in practice?
- Asking how your choices ripple through systems  
- Caring for relationships — with people, place, time, tools  
- Practicing discernment in a noisy world  
- Welcoming feedback, tension, and change  

This is Shared Planet Citizen. Not a job. Not a badge.
Just the invitation to live. To live well — individually and together.
To accept that this is hard. But from this, everything else follows.

Let’s play.
