# The United Citizens of a Shared Planet
*A roleplay initiative for collective imagination, civic experimentation, and future-making.*

We are not states.  
We are not leaders.  
We are just citizens — united by the shared condition of living together on one fragile, remarkable planet.

This is a **roleplay experiment** to imagine what a **citizens’ mirror** to the United Nations might look like.  
A playful prototype of global civic participation, accountability, and shared responsibility — from the ground up.

## Why?

Because governance doesn’t have to be left to governments.  
Because imagination is a political act.  
Because it's time to practice being planetary.

## The Independent Powers (So Far)

To explore different modes of civic action, the initiative starts with semi-fictional, self-governing branches of planetary citizen power:

- **Doocracy** — for those who act and build  
- **Democracy** — for those who vote and debate  
- **Syntheocracy** — for those who engage with spiritual, philosophical, ideological, and religious life to help shape our shared sense of meaning and direction.  
- **Ludocracy** — for those who speak through art, play, humor, and critique
- **Bureaucracy** — for those who regulate through policies, procedures, laws, and formal structures to ensure consistency, fairness, and accountability.

Each branch will define its own rituals, roles, and outputs.  
All are welcome to contribute, remix, or mirror these experiments in their own communities.

## This is not official.  
It’s not even fully serious.  
But it could be real — if we make it so.

## Want to Begin?

- Start a local “citizen council” and adopt a branch.
- Fork this repo and add your own declarations, rituals, or mock sessions.
- Write a speech to the *Assembly of Shared Citizens*.
- Invite others to play.
- Invite and Share on social media

This is not the final draft of humanity.  
Let’s roleplay better ones.

*Let the sessions begin.*

Let's Play!
