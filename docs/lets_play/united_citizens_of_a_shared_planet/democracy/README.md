# Democracy Branch  
*A voice among the powers of the United Citizens of a Shared Planet*

Welcome to the **Democracy Branch** — where deliberation, participation, disagreement, and shared direction are the heart of planetary civic life.

This is the space for those who believe in the value of **dialogue**, **representation**, **consent**, and **accountability** — and for those who want to test, challenge, and evolve these ideas in light of today’s real conditions.

## What we stand for

From the ancient Athenian assembly to modern parliaments, democracy has always been an experiment:  
How can people **share power** — fairly, openly, and wisely?

This branch:
- Upholds the principle that **everyone deserves a voice**, not just a vote.
- Welcomes **civil disagreement** as a tool for deeper understanding.
- Explores new and old methods for **deciding together** — from sortition and citizen assemblies to online deliberation and mock elections.
- Seeks to **repair**, not replicate, the flaws of current systems: exclusion, polarization, apathy, corruption.

## What we do

- Host role-play sessions of alternative democratic processes  
- Draft, vote on, and revise proposals from other branches  
- Reflect publicly on collective decisions and their outcomes  
- Build tools and practices for more inclusive, responsive governance

## This is democracy — not perfection

Democracy is messy. But it’s also **beautifully unfinished**.  
Here, you’re invited to join that unfinished work — not as a spectator, but as a co-creator.

This branch exists to **listen, argue, decide, and revise** — in pursuit of better ways to live together.

Let’s imagine democracy beyond what we’ve inherited.
Let’s practice — together.
Let’s explore.
