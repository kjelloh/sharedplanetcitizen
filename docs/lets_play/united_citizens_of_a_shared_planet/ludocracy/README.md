# Ludocracy  
*A branch of the United Citizens of a Shared Planet*

## Laughing truth to power.

**Ludocracy** is the domain of jesters, clowns, artists, satirists, storytellers, tricksters, and anyone brave enough to use humor, play, and creativity to question power and awaken collective insight.

Where others lead with law, vote, or creed — Ludocracy leads with *laughter*, *imagination*, and *provocation*.

This is not mere entertainment. This is sacred mischief.

## What we believe (and mock lovingly)

Ludocracy holds a core suspicion:  
> That the jester, once welcome at the king’s table, was not a fool — but the only one who could tell the truth without losing their head.

We believe laughter opens locked doors.  
That humor disarms fear.  
That play invites participation.  
That satire can say what sermons, policies, or speeches cannot.

We explore what hides in silence, fear, and solemnity — and bring it into light through absurdity, parody, joy, and surprise.

## What we do

Ludocracy is a place for:

- Public acts of play and parody  
- Art that reveals what argument cannot  
- Satirical performance and social critique  
- Humor that opens, not wounds  
- Games that raise consciousness  
- Theatre that stirs empathy  
- Clowning that speaks truth  
- Ridiculous rituals that reveal real power

We welcome the spirit of stand-up comics, carnival processions, meme-makers, theatre troupes, trickster gods, graffiti artists, and anyone who wears the red nose with courage.

## Our role in the planetary whole

Where **Democracy** debates, **Doocracy** builds, **Bureaucracy** regulates, and **Syntheocracy** reflects — **Ludocracy** pokes, prods, and plays.

We test the wisdom of the powerful not with force, but with foolishness.  
We offer refuge from righteousness.  
We hold up the mirror, often curved, to show what’s been missed.

We know:  
> In a world overwhelmed by seriousness, play is radical.  
> In systems built on pretense, laughter is subversive.

There is no membership, no hierarchy, no official joke.

## Why it matters

Ludocracy reminds us that power must be able to laugh at itself — or it risks becoming brittle, blind, and cruel.

It reminds us that we are more likely to change what we can joke about.

And that laughter, far from trivial, is how humans survive the unbearable and sometimes discover the truth.

Join us. Bring your paint, your mask, your mischief.  
The world is serious enough.  

Let’s play!
